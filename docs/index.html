My name is Sean Carolan and I'm a Solutions Engineer with HashiCorp. I like building things. In my past life I was a Linux system administrator, now I travel and help users get started with Infrastructure as Code. My first computer was a Commodore 64. 

This photo was taken a few years ago at the Living Computer Museum. If you are ever in Seattle, you owe it to yourself to make a pilgrimage to this place. There's nothing that makes you feel old like seeing your childhood toy in a museum. Elliot and I are playing Oregon Trail on an Apple IIe.

Password Rotation!  Woooo!  Who's with me?  No...nobody?  Why isn't anyone excited?  Are you sure you don't want to go hear about Terraform 0.12?  Ok, you're stuck with me!

Let's be honest, nobody came to this talk because they like changing passwords. I'll give you an example...(Advance to Next slide)

I did some research and found the inventor of the modern computer password...

???
This dashing gentleman is Fernando Corbató. He is one of the pioneers of timesharing computer systems. He lead the team that developed the first Compatible Time Sharing System for mainframe computers. He also invented the modern computer password.

You see, back in those days computers were giant hulking machines that filled entire rooms. These powerful machines were big and expensive to run. Users would write their programs on punch cards, and then submit the punch cards to operators to run. (Think about that next time you go to deploy your code...)

Programs were put in a queue and run in serial, and you often had to wait days or hours for your program to run. It wasn't practical to have developers connected to the mainframe all the time, because most of the time they were writing code, not actually running it.

Fernando and his team invented time sharing to solve this problem. Multiple users could now connect to the same mainframe computer, and the idle time of one user could be used by another user connected to the system. Finally multiple users could interact with the mainframe system in real time. 

"The key problem was that we were setting up multiple terminals which were to be used by multiple persons but with each person having his own private set of files," he told Wired. "Putting a password on for each individual user as a lock seemed like a very straightforward solution."

Thus the password was born...

And if Hollywood has taught us anything, it's that the handsome scientist's experiment is going to go horribly wrong by the end of the movie...

???
Ok, maybe things didn't turn out quite *that* badly. Dr. Corbato is still alive and healthy, and he didn't turn into a fly. But there problems with the password began almost immediately.

Less than a year after the password was invented, the first instance of password theft occurred in 1962.

You see, these machines were very expensive to run and you were sharing them with everyone else on the team. Each user was allocated only four hours per week of compute time for their projects. 

One of the other researchers on the project, Dr. Allan Scherr, was frustrated with the 4 hour time limit. He knew that there was an 'offline print' function whereby you could submit a punchcard, and print out files overnight while no one was in the lab. So he submitted a job to print out the entire list of system passwords on Friday night, and picked it up first thing on Saturday morning.

In order to cover his tracks he shared the password list with several other users, one of whom immediately began to troll the administrator by leaving messages on the system under his user account.

And just like a sci-fi movie plot, the brilliant scientist's creation eventually came back to haunt him. "It's become kind of a nightmare," says the 87-year-old retired researcher. "I don't think anybody can possibly remember all the passwords."

Let's turn the clock forward a bit to the 1970s...

This morning, just for fun I wanted to log onto the oldest legacy machine I could find. The Living Computer Museum that I mentioned on the first slide has a bunch of legacy machines that you can get accounts on. This one is a PDP-11/70, first built in 1975. This particular machine is running Unix v7. Everybody's passwords on this machine are still stored in that same file, but we've made some improvements.

The password was here to stay, and for a long time passwords were stored in plaintext, usually in a file called /etc/passwd. In the 1970s, Robert Morris developed a way to store passwords in a hashed form. This way the computer system didn't have to store your password in plain text, making it much harder for someone to guess your password. Later the concept of the 'salted' hash was created, whereby we add some random data to the password before hashing it. These measures made things a little bit better but there are still many ways password authentication can go wrong.

But as time went by, computers got more powerful. Breaking a simple hashed password can now be done in seconds with a password cracking tool. Security experts have long recommended regular rotation of passwords. Security experts also recommended longer passwords with numbers and symbols in them. Let's go ahead and try to set our password!

Why does this happen? Because we like to torture our users with really weird complexity requirements for passwords. Humans can on average, reliably remember a group of 7 digits, six letters, and five words. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two

Believe it or not there was a time when many of us could recite a dozen phone numbers by heart.

Can anyone remember five phone numbers? Three? Do you know any phone numbers? Some people don't even remember own phone number anymore.

Yet we've told our poor users they have to remember this string of 8 or 10 digits/symbols/letters.

What if instead we gave them a string of four or five words to learn?

Now you only have to remember four things. You already know how to spell these words so you no longer have to memorize each and every letter. Sadly super long passwords made of words are not supported on many systems, because they are not 'complex' enough.

Nowadays we have to have a 'wallet' or 'password safe' just to keep track of the many passwords we use for various accounts and services. Many people store their passwords on their browser or in an app on their smartphone. So the situation on personal devices is more or less tolerable...but how can we deal with password rotation on servers and cloud instances? What if you have 300 machines to manage, each with its own local accounts?

What if you could instead hand out usernames and passwords that would automatically expire. Users and applications can simply check out new credentials when they need them, use them for a specific amount of time, and then the credentials automatically vanish when they expire?  Sounds great doesn't it?

Imagine a ski resort. You walk up to the main counter and purchase a lift pass. The lift pass is like dynamic credentials. You might have a beginner's pass that is only good for the bunny slopes. Or you might have a pass that gives you elevated privileges, and allows you to ride to the top of the mountain. All of the passes have an expiration date on them. You simply present your pass at the lift, an employee scans it (or it happens automatically via RFID), and you get access to the lift.

Vault works the same way. You can request database credentials, or public cloud API keys, and get temporary access to the systems and APIs that you need to work with?

Sounds great right? Yes, I can hear you thinking..."But Sean, I'm stuck with all these legacy machines that I have to manage, and we can't do all this fancy dynamic stuff."

Let's talk about legacy systems. Do any of you have a machine like this on your network? 

Who here manages legacy systems for your organization? Please stand up. Let's give these people a hand. These folks are heroes for taking care of those ancient systems that nobody else wants to touch. Ok you can sit back down, that is your praise for the year.  Make it last. Isn't it true though? What a thankless job. Be nice to your sysadmins and ops people.

What are we going to do about these legacy systems? Some of my customers have started giving them new names. A couple weeks ago an IT director introduced me to his "Classic" environment. But I think my favorite is the bank, with their "Heritage" collection of machines. Heritage systems. You can put that on your resume. Curator of Heritage Systems.

If there's one thing we know about these legacy systems, it's that they are not going away any time soon. These dinosaurs have survived this long, and somebody's gotta care for them. The security team says the root and admin passwords on these boxes has to be rotated every 90 days. How are we going to tackle this challenge?

*What if an attacker gets their hands on one of these system tokens?*

* Can write arbitrary data to systemcreds/linux or systemcreds/windows
* Cannot overwrite existing password, could roll off all previous versions
* Possibly write so much data that the k/v storage gets filled up
* DDOS or failure of Vault cluster could lock you out of systems

*Possible ways to mitigate risk*
* Configure Vault token so it can only be used during a short time window (5 minutes). Example: 03:57:30 to 04:02:30. (Enterprise)
* Limit length of data that can be written into the k/v store. (Enterprise)
