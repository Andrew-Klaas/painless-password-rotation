My name is Sean Carolan and I'm a Solutions Engineer with HashiCorp. I like building things. In my past life I was a Linux system administrator, now I travel and help users get started with Infrastructure as Code.

Ideas for slides/content

* Introductory slide (Seattle Computer Museum?)
* Why is password rotation so hard?
* Legacy systems and the sysadmins who love them
* Photo of floppy disk or other legacy tech
* Why don't you just sprinkle some devops on that?
* How can we solve this password rotation problem?

* Design process for password rotation system
  - Each machine responsible for its own password rotation
  - No external software required. Works with bash or powershell.
  - Machines may update their own password but not read it from Vault
  - N number of previous password versions stored in Vault
  - Humans can be granted read access to passwords by policy
  - Passwords should be rotated every 24 hours
  - Generate either secure passwords or passphrases

* What is a passphrase? XKCD comic with correct-battery-horse-staple
